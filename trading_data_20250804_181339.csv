AAPL,2025-01-31 16:46:00,reddit,"AAPL - 26,527.62% return over 25 years
Today to the day is the anniversary of twenty five years of my first purchase of AAPL shares.  I bought 1200 dollars worth.

In early 2000, I had just graduated college.  I had a few thousand given to me as an inheritance that was being managed by a broker.

 I asked the broker about purchasing some Apple shares, and he was unimpressed, and unmoved. I was annoyed at him. Apple was the one I had the strongest impulse to purchase.

 Why apple? I had gone from being skeptical of Apple. My  college was very heavily Mac, but I had PCs.  I was unimpressed at the OS, but I was struck by people’s reactions to Jobs.  He was enthusiastic, and I liked the cut of the jib who liked the cut of his jib. I was drawn to the elitism of the people to the brand, and felt it could bounce back. This was even before iPods, mind you, before OS X.  

These were the days of the dotcom boom. This broker was taking like 500 bucks for every trade. This felt unfair, in light of the great digital democratization that was in progress, I wanted the power.  And E*trade was relatively new and it seemed legit.  I hadn’t done anything like this before, I was just a kid, really, but I decided to just go for it. 

I sold most of the shares I inherited, and threw 1200 bucks into Apple.  `(also a few other, less impressive stocks)' I did marvelously the first few months as the market soared, as did most people. 

And…. it  came tumbling down in April 2000.  Disillusioned, I decided not to try to reposition my shares, and I just let things ride for a few months.  When I rebalanced by portfolio, I kept my apple shares, which had split, despite the pull-back.

Every year, I would consider would I buy more apple now?  And it didn't occurr me to sell. Apple often seemed almost comically undervalued, and I held on or increased my investment in it.

Every time apple goes up 1 point, I get more than my initial investment back. Why? Splits.

•	2-for-1 split in 2000  
•	2-for-1 split in 2005  
•	7-for-1 split in 2014  
•	4-for-1 split in 2020

Nowadays cost basis: .88 cents.     As of today that investment has grown 26,527.62%. I added more and more apple across the years, and had some other lucky calls (my second largest holding is NVDA) but no move matches that whimsical lucky move of 25 years ago today.

The security that owning these securities has offered me is significant.  It has let me have a job that isn’t that well-payed and support my family with emergencies being take of by extra funds. We own a lot of apple products, because with the dividends, it sort of just pays for them.

I do think it’s good to give early adults access to a few thousand dollars to play the market and plan to do that with my own children.  Although I didn’t sell my shares, what I did do is convert a bunch of them to a donor advised fund (avoiding taxes, whee), and I give to charity from that for annual giving, and that feels like a win win win proposition.  

I do feel overexposed in AAPL and NVDA, but due to still hopefully having another at least 25 years to go in my life is that pullbacks eventually come back up. The biggest principle that has guided my investing is “Don’t buy crap if you can help it”, and that's my advice to new investors.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iej3mb/aapl_2652762_return_over_25_years/,,
AAPL,2023-09-07 13:15:44,reddit,"China plans to expand its ban on iPhones, AAPL drops 3%+
**China plans to expand a ban on the use of iPhones in sensitive departments** to government-backed agencies and state companies, a sign of growing challenges for Apple Inc. in its biggest foreign market and global production base.

Several agencies have begun instructing staff not to bring their iPhones to work, people familiar with the matter said, affirming a previous report from the Wall Street Journal. In addition, **Beijing intends to extend that restriction far more broadly to a plethora of state-owned enterprises and other government-controlled organizations**, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a sensitive matter.

If Beijing goes ahead, **the unprecedented blockade will be the culmination of a yearslong effort to root out foreign technology use** in sensitive environments, coinciding with Beijing’s effort to reduce its reliance on American software and circuitry. It **threatens to erode Apple’s position in a market that yields about a fifth of its revenue**, and from where it makes the majority of the world’s iPhones through sprawling factories that employ millions of Chinese.

Chinese state firms like oil giant PetroChina Co. employ millions and control vast swathes of a centrally planned economy. Given Apple’s relationship with Beijing and its importance to the economy, it “has historically been viewed as relatively safe in China from government restrictions,” KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Brandon Nispel said in a report Wednesday. “Is the government changing its stance?”

A representative for Cupertino, California-based Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment. The State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission and the State Council Information Office didn’t respond to faxed requests for comment.

Microsoft has been a giant for decades. They continually print money while being that giant in the background while everyone else clamors for other tech names. They have pumped on cloud revenue and the expanding of their AI.   
  
I am in my first year of investing, and I'm wondering if MSFT after pumping post-earnings is still a valuable buy, or if I should wait for it to cool off. How much do they have room to grow, and is there a better play for pure cloud exposure? It would seem to me, their investment in OpenAI and Azure will be big for the AI industry moving forward, but there is the risk that AI doesn't find the profitability compared to spending people think it will. They clearly have the money to buy smaller players, and are still an industry leader for a reason.

ARTICLE TLDR: Microsoft and OpenAI are reportedly collaborating on a massive data-center project estimated to cost up to $100 billion. The initiative includes the development of an artificial intelligence supercomputer named ""Stargate."" While the companies have not officially commented on the project, sources suggest that Microsoft will likely finance it. Stargate is anticipated to be operational by 2028, marking the final phase of OpenAI's AI upgrade. This U.S.-based supercomputer is part of a series of installations planned over the next six years. The projected cost of $100 billion has been attributed to conversations with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft's initial cost estimates. The project is progressing through five phases, with Stargate as the fifth phase, while Microsoft is concurrently working on a smaller, fourth-phase supercomputer for OpenAI. The focus of the current phase is on procuring AI chips necessary for the subsequent phases.

TSLA,2025-03-09 23:35:58,reddit,"TSLA being investigated by Transport Canada for cooking their books in Canada to snag EV rebates without selling cars.
The article notes that **four Tesla dealerships claimed to have sold 8,653 Teslas in 3 days.** Assuming each dealership opens from 9AM-5PM, that's **90 cars sold per hour per dealership**. Worth noting that Canada's EV rebate program was set to shut down, interesting how Tesla found 8,600 sales in 3 days before it did...

Ironic that Musk, who has recently repeatedly said that people who rely on government payments are leeches and that Canada is not a real country, is now accused of trying to leech off of Canadian taxpayer-funded EV rebates himself to the tune of $43M.

I guess that's one way to maintain revenue while sales drop 90%!

Note: investigation is ongoing and there has been no confirmation of official wrongdoing yet.

Edit: Since this post got more attention then I expected. Yes I posted this Sunday and TSLA is currently down 13% today.
