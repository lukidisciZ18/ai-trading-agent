Tesla has granted 96 million new shares worth about $29 billion to CEO Elon Musk.

""The interim award shares vest only if Musk remains in a key executive role through 2027. They also come with a five-year holding period except to cover tax payments or the purchase price.""

""It added that if the Delaware courts fully reinstate the 2018 CEO Performance Award, the new interim grant will either be forfeited or offset and there will be no ""double dip,""""

The original package valued at over $50 billion was voided by a Delaware court in 2024.  Musk appealed, and the Tesla board subsequently formed a special committee to consider some compensation.
