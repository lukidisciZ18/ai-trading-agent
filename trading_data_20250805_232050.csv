TQQQ,2024-03-09 23:30:59,reddit,"People who have been holding TQQQ from its inception are really profiting that much?
New to stock market.

I did some research on leveraged etfs and I found TQQQ used to be 1 dollar. If someone long hold TQQQ back in the day, are they really profiting 60 times if they sell it now?

 It seemed to good to be true, so I also checked some weird shits behind the veil, and apparently some reputable websites say leveraged etfs tend to have significant tracking error in a long run and they are for day traders, not suitable for long hold.

In this case, I would like to know why based on the price now and total return over the past ten years, TQQQ seems to be a good choice for long hold if someone dump some money they will never use into it.

I saw a post earlier on this sub justifying 100% portfolio in TQQQ. TQQQ has been back tested for Dot com bubble. It would have taken 2 decades to get your original investment back if you bought at the peak of Dot com bubble.

My portfolio current is 100% TQQQ with no margin. My game plan is quite simple. Buy every, single, dip. And simply continue doing that. 3% down buy 5 more. 1% down, buy another 5 more and on and on. Do you consider this a truly good strategy that will end up in success? I have no other positions and will NOT be needing the money in the longterm future. I expect I will hold this position for 5-10 years than revise my strategy when I'm 26-31 years old.

Can someone tell me what I’m missing? They say this stock is a short term hold and too risky as a long term hold. How is that true if it’s up 1,500% in the last 5 years and outperformed all other indexs and ETFs? It’s also up almost 20,000% in the last 10 years.

Hello, 

Ive been looking into leveraged etfs and found a few that seem decent with decent returns. I understand these are riskier but I’m looking to diversify my portfolio with one of these. 

Current holdings are icln, qcln, tesla, churchill and bb. I have some cash sitting thanks to making some money off those meme stocks last week. 

Any suggestions on good leveraged etfs? What are the pros/ cons? Any good Canadian ones?
