AAPL,2025-01-31 16:46:00,reddit,"AAPL - 26,527.62% return over 25 years
Today to the day is the anniversary of twenty five years of my first purchase of AAPL shares.  I bought 1200 dollars worth.

In early 2000, I had just graduated college.  I had a few thousand given to me as an inheritance that was being managed by a broker.

 I asked the broker about purchasing some Apple shares, and he was unimpressed, and unmoved. I was annoyed at him. Apple was the one I had the strongest impulse to purchase.

 Why apple? I had gone from being skeptical of Apple. My  college was very heavily Mac, but I had PCs.  I was unimpressed at the OS, but I was struck by people’s reactions to Jobs.  He was enthusiastic, and I liked the cut of the jib who liked the cut of his jib. I was drawn to the elitism of the people to the brand, and felt it could bounce back. This was even before iPods, mind you, before OS X.  

These were the days of the dotcom boom. This broker was taking like 500 bucks for every trade. This felt unfair, in light of the great digital democratization that was in progress, I wanted the power.  And E*trade was relatively new and it seemed legit.  I hadn’t done anything like this before, I was just a kid, really, but I decided to just go for it. 

I sold most of the shares I inherited, and threw 1200 bucks into Apple.  `(also a few other, less impressive stocks)' I did marvelously the first few months as the market soared, as did most people. 

And…. it  came tumbling down in April 2000.  Disillusioned, I decided not to try to reposition my shares, and I just let things ride for a few months.  When I rebalanced by portfolio, I kept my apple shares, which had split, despite the pull-back.

Every year, I would consider would I buy more apple now?  And it didn't occurr me to sell. Apple often seemed almost comically undervalued, and I held on or increased my investment in it.

Every time apple goes up 1 point, I get more than my initial investment back. Why? Splits.

•	2-for-1 split in 2000  
•	2-for-1 split in 2005  
•	7-for-1 split in 2014  
•	4-for-1 split in 2020

Nowadays cost basis: .88 cents.     As of today that investment has grown 26,527.62%. I added more and more apple across the years, and had some other lucky calls (my second largest holding is NVDA) but no move matches that whimsical lucky move of 25 years ago today.

The security that owning these securities has offered me is significant.  It has let me have a job that isn’t that well-payed and support my family with emergencies being take of by extra funds. We own a lot of apple products, because with the dividends, it sort of just pays for them.

I do think it’s good to give early adults access to a few thousand dollars to play the market and plan to do that with my own children.  Although I didn’t sell my shares, what I did do is convert a bunch of them to a donor advised fund (avoiding taxes, whee), and I give to charity from that for annual giving, and that feels like a win win win proposition.  

I do feel overexposed in AAPL and NVDA, but due to still hopefully having another at least 25 years to go in my life is that pullbacks eventually come back up. The biggest principle that has guided my investing is “Don’t buy crap if you can help it”, and that's my advice to new investors.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iej3mb/aapl_2652762_return_over_25_years/
AAPL,2023-09-07 13:15:44,reddit,"China plans to expand its ban on iPhones, AAPL drops 3%+
**China plans to expand a ban on the use of iPhones in sensitive departments** to government-backed agencies and state companies, a sign of growing challenges for Apple Inc. in its biggest foreign market and global production base.

Several agencies have begun instructing staff not to bring their iPhones to work, people familiar with the matter said, affirming a previous report from the Wall Street Journal. In addition, **Beijing intends to extend that restriction far more broadly to a plethora of state-owned enterprises and other government-controlled organizations**, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a sensitive matter.

If Beijing goes ahead, **the unprecedented blockade will be the culmination of a yearslong effort to root out foreign technology use** in sensitive environments, coinciding with Beijing’s effort to reduce its reliance on American software and circuitry. It **threatens to erode Apple’s position in a market that yields about a fifth of its revenue**, and from where it makes the majority of the world’s iPhones through sprawling factories that employ millions of Chinese.

Chinese state firms like oil giant PetroChina Co. employ millions and control vast swathes of a centrally planned economy. Given Apple’s relationship with Beijing and its importance to the economy, it “has historically been viewed as relatively safe in China from government restrictions,” KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Brandon Nispel said in a report Wednesday. “Is the government changing its stance?”

A representative for Cupertino, California-based Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment. The State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission and the State Council Information Office didn’t respond to faxed requests for comment.

Now I’m not saying to sell all of your Apple stock immediately. However, given that:

2. iPhone sales are down almost 10%

3. Services didn’t grow as much as we thought they would

4. Apple doing a buyback instead of investing more in R&D (it seems like they’re doing a lot of buybacks lately..)

5. Slow growth in critical markets like China

6. No major product line releases in the future. The Vision Pro was a dud and was too expensive - they thought about doing a car but cancelled that. What’s the next new thing?

ARTICLE TLDR: Microsoft and OpenAI are reportedly collaborating on a massive data-center project estimated to cost up to $100 billion. The initiative includes the development of an artificial intelligence supercomputer named ""Stargate."" While the companies have not officially commented on the project, sources suggest that Microsoft will likely finance it. Stargate is anticipated to be operational by 2028, marking the final phase of OpenAI's AI upgrade. This U.S.-based supercomputer is part of a series of installations planned over the next six years. The projected cost of $100 billion has been attributed to conversations with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft's initial cost estimates. The project is progressing through five phases, with Stargate as the fifth phase, while Microsoft is concurrently working on a smaller, fourth-phase supercomputer for OpenAI. The focus of the current phase is on procuring AI chips necessary for the subsequent phases.

According to the Financial Times Microsoft may terminate ongoing talks to deepen its partnership with OpenAI citing unresolved disputes over governance and future equity structure

The core issue OpenAI is pushing to formally transition into a for-profit entity which could potentially dilute Microsoft influence and ownership stake in the company  especially concerning any future models beyond GPT-4

Sources say that unless key terms are agreed upon Microsoft is ready to fall back on its existing commercial agreement which guarantees access to OpenAI models through 2030  unless a competitor matches or exceeds Microsoft's deal

Another twist OpenAI transition plan reportedly needs Microsoft formal approval by Dec 31, 2025. Without that green light OpenAI may risk losing interest from outside investors like SoftBank and other late-stage capital.

Despite the headlines, Microsoft commercial use case remains protected in the shorttomid term. But the question now is who controls the roadmap to GPT-5 and beyond  and whether Microsoft sees enough ROI to keep playing ball.

I’m no Tesla expert, and I’m sure plenty of people know way more about the company than I do, but I wanted to throw out some thoughts and see what you all think.



Right now, TSLA is sitting around $330 a share, up 75% YOY. But honestly, I see some major red flags:



📉 Shrinking Profit Margins – Tesla’s margins have been steadily declining for years. Not a great trend.



🏴‍☠️ Musk’s PR Nightmare – Elon literally gave a “Sieg Heil” on live TV. Now, a huge chunk of the world sees him (and by extension, Tesla) as a Nazi. That’s… not exactly great for brand reputation.



🚗 Cybertruck is a Mess – Poor build quality, tons of issues, and at this point, it’s basically a meme.



🌍 New Political & Tariff Risks – Tesla is vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, an anti-EV U.S. President, and a California governor who hates Musk and might pull state EV rebates.



⚡ Serious Competition is Catching Up – Tesla isn’t the undisputed EV/FSD leader anymore. Other companies are matching—or surpassing—them in innovation.



🚦 FSD is Overhyped – Despite all the robotaxi talk, Tesla’s self-driving tech is still only Level 2-3. Meanwhile, other companies already have Level 4 robotaxis on the road.



🔋 Rising Costs = Profit Squeeze – Raw material costs are going up, and Trump’s tariffs on China-made batteries could make things even worse.



🤖 Tesla is Struggling to Attract Top AI Talent – Even before Musk’s latest antics, nearly all top AI researchers and recent ML PhD graduates from the top schools were choosing OpenAI, Anthropic, or GAMMA (Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Apple) over Tesla or xAI. Now? Even fewer want to work there, which could hurt Tesla’s AI progress.



🔵 Losing Left-Leaning Consumers – Left-leaning buyers are way more likely to buy EVs than right-leaning ones. And almost every left-leaning consumer has grown to despise Musk, leading them to choose non-Tesla EVs instead.



Tesla used to be the Nvidia of EVs—they were miles ahead of everyone else. But that’s just not the case anymore. There are more non-Tesla EV options every year, and in terms of FSD, several companies already have a better product and better talent. So, to me, a $1.1 trillion valuation feels ridiculous.

NVDA,2025-06-29 15:05:17,reddit,"The NVDA journey has just begun
Nvidia is at the centre of the AI revolution, with breakthrough products and great opportunities ahead that continue to exceed my expectations.

Recent innovations such as the Blackwell GB200 NVL72 and expanding AI applications, including robotics, solidify Nvidia's dominant market position and growth potential.

Despite a record valuation, Nvidia's history of growing profits at a rate above valuation is unlikely to end.

I remain a committed long-term buyer of NVDA and I believe that Nvidia's leadership in AI and data centre technology makes it a must-have stock, despite the short-term risks.

How about now? NVIDIA's stock price and valuation just hit an all-time high, and many investors are wondering if NVIDIA is overvalued. Maybe they should take profits? Surely we'll see some short sellers active. For me, the journey has just begun. Since my recent article NVIDIA has announced some significant partnerships and at the recent GTC Paris conference its CEO made it clear to me that the growth story behind AI is continuing to accelerate. Let me bring you up to speed while we review whether NVIDIA remains a worthwhile buying opportunity.

It's worth noting that the US or Asia aren't the only ones committed to AI development - Europe is also active and not far behind. While Europe isn't often mentioned in these discussions (there's even a joke that the US owns AI while Europe has an ‘AI Act’ to regulate it), NVIDIA has highlighted its involvement in industrial/physical AI From the heart of Germany's automotive industry to the manufacturing hubs of France and Italy, Europe is adopting industrial AI and advanced AI robotics to address labour shortages, increase productivity and drive sustainable economic growth.

Robotics companies are developing humanoid robots and collaborative systems to integrate AI into real-world manufacturing applications. Backed by a $200bn investment programme and a coordinated effort by the European Commission, Europe is at the forefront of the next wave of AI-driven industrial automation.

It's easy to get caught up in concerns about potential overvaluation once the stock hits another record high. Take a look at NVDA's P/E ratio trend (I usually focus on EV/EBITDA, but it's showing the same trend). Since April 2025, the P/E has risen significantly as valuations have experienced a dynamic recovery (over 50%).

What's the key to deciding whether it's worth paying nearly $50 per share for $1 in earnings? It's the growth story behind NVIDIA and its continued path. NVIDIA's performance over the past few years suggests that it has a very good growth habit to reach its valuation levels. Just look at its P/E ratio in July 2023 - over 240x! Now, what surprises me is that buyers of NVIDIA actually made a lot of money during that time :)

How is that possible? NVIDIA's earnings are growing faster than its valuation. That's why you observe that valuation multiples have been declining since early 2024. Yes, the valuation multiple is now up nearly 50x, but ...... if NVIDIA continues on this path, delivers on its intended product roadmap, and the world continues to move towards an AI-driven economy, NVIDIA's current valuation will look cheap in a few years.

Risk factors? There are many, and there are no risk-free investments in the stock market. If the Trump administration escalates the trade war, which is currently on hold, NVIDIA could face some short-term issues that would impact NVIDIA's supply and customer operations. Yes, NVIDIA is well prepared for these changes, with some production being shifted to the U.S. and adjusted supply for Chinese customers (due to export restrictions). Any economic or geopolitical fluctuations could also hurt market sentiment, but in the long run I don't see this as a factor.

So, as an investor with a long-term focus and a bright future for NVIDIA, not only am I not selling any shares, I'm adding to my holdings. For me, NVIDIA remains a ‘Strong Buy’ stock. Cheers!",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lngvg0/the_nvda_journey_has_just_begun/

Perplexity and OpenAI are both supposedly going to “challenge” Google’s search business, and that’s rattling investors everywhere.

This is interesting because Google’s total ad revenue in Q1 2025 was $67bn and Search contributed for nearly 74% of that. And, according to the DOJ filings in the ongoing antitrust case, **about 35 % of all Google search queries originate inside Chrome**, driving “billions in Search revenue.”

Meaning, three-quarters of every dollar Alphabet makes still flows through ads, most of which *start in a browser tab.* Every point of share that Chrome loses risks a direct dent in Alphabet’s main cash engine. Barclays estimates a 5-point loss of Chrome share could shave **>$3 B off quarterly Search sales.** That’s a big dent.

However, It’s good to know that all the commotion so far is still - *just commotion*. For reference, Google has dominated the browser race since the introduction of chrome in 2008, with a \~68% global share. The next in line is Edge with a \~13% share. 

Additionally: ""Historically, only \~20% of Google searches were monetizable. With Al-driven personalization and intent inference, this funnel is expanding.""

https://preview.redd.it/x9frloax13cf1.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cf8ecc1063d22b2d57009bdd1fab03b207f5a77b

Coming to the \~15% drop in $GOOG, Q1 saw double-digit top-line growth and a fat 34 % operating margin for Alphabet. Yet sentiment is ruled by forward risk, and the stock is now priced at \~17x forward earnings. 

The public sentiment about who’s leading the AI race changes every other week, but Google’s Gemini is almost never last in any list. This, combined with Google’s already pretty big stronghold on the search and browser business means they have a significant advantage over the competition when it comes to AI **and** browsers. (it’s pretty well known that Google has implemented AI into chrome for a good while now)

Search(ads) and browsers are Google’s moats. Google knows this, and they haven’t stopped innovating. 

Looking ahead, the hard catalyst is the antitrust ruling for Chrome in August. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s browser is supposedly weeks away, and Perplexity’s ‘Comet’ is already in Public Beta. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lwixnh/how_screwed_is_goog_really/

#Trump’s Aggression Sours Europe on US Cloud Giants

###Companies in the EU are starting to look for ways to ditch Amazon, Google, and Microsoft cloud services amid fears of rising security risks from the US. But cutting ties won’t be easy.

> The global backlash against the second Donald Trump administration keeps on growing. Canadians have boycotted US-made products, anti–Elon Musk posters have appeared across London amid widespread Tesla protests, and European officials have drastically increased military spending as US support for Ukraine falters. Dominant US tech services may be the next focus.

> There are early signs that some European companies and governments are souring on their use of American cloud services provided by the three so-called hyperscalers. Between them, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) host vast swathes of the internet and keep thousands of businesses running. However, some organizations appear to be reconsidering their use of these companies’ cloud services—including servers, storage, and databases—citing uncertainties around privacy and data access fears under the Trump administration.

> “There’s a huge appetite in Europe to de-risk or decouple the over-dependence on US tech companies, because there is a concern that they could be weaponized against European interests,” says Marietje Schaake, a nonresident fellow at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center and a former, decade-long member of the European Parliament.

> The moves may already be underway. On March 18, politicians in the Netherlands House of Representatives passed eight motions asking the government to reduce reliance on US tech companies and move to European alternatives. Days before, more than 100 organizations signed an open letter to European officials calling for the continent to become “more technologically independent” and saying the status quo creates “security and reliability risks.”

> Two European-based cloud service companies, Exoscale and Elastx, tell WIRED they have seen an uptick in potential customers looking to abandon US cloud providers over the last two weeks—with some already starting to make the jump. Multiple technology advisers say they are having widespread discussions about what it would take to uproot services, data, and systems.

> “We have more demand from across Europe,” says Mathias Nöbauer, the CEO of Swiss-based hosting provider Exoscale, adding there has been an increase in new customers seeking to move away from cloud giants. “Some customers were very explicit,” Nöbauer says. “Especially customers from Denmark being very explicit that they want to move away from US hyperscalers because of the US administration and what they said about Greenland.”

> “It's a big worry about the uncertainty around everything. And from the Europeans’ perspective—that the US is maybe not on the same team as us any longer,” says Joakim Öhman, the CEO of Swedish cloud provider Elastx. “Those are the drivers that bring people or organizations to look at alternatives.”

> Concerns have been raised about the current data-sharing agreement between the EU and US, which is designed to allow information to move between the two continents while protecting people’s rights. Multiple previous versions of the agreement have been struck down by European courts. At the end of January, Trump fired three Democrats from the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), which helps manage the current agreement. The move could undermine or increase uncertainty around the agreement. In addition, Öhman says, he has heard concerns from firms about the CLOUD Act, which can allow US law enforcement to subpoena user data from tech companies, potentially including data that is stored in systems outside of the US.

> Dave Cottlehuber, the founder of SkunkWerks, a small tech infrastructure firm in Austria, says he has been moving the company’s few servers and databases away from US providers to European services since the start of the year. “First and foremost, it’s about values,” Cottlehuber says. “For me, privacy is a right not a privilege.” Cottlehuber says the decision to move is easier for a small business such as his, but he argues it removes some taxes that are paid to the Trump administration. “The best thing I can do is to remove that small contribution of mine, and also at the same time, make sure that my customers’ privacy is respected and preserved,” Cottlehuber says.

> Steffen Schmidt, the CEO of Medicusdata, a company that provides text-to-speech services to doctors and hospitals in Europe, says that having data in Europe has always “been a must,” but his customers have been asking for more in recent weeks. “Since the beginning of 2025, in addition to data residency guarantees, customers have actively asked us to use cloud providers that are natively European companies,” Schmidt says, adding that some of his services have been moved to Nöbauer’s Exoscale.

> Harry Staight, a spokesperson for AWS, says it is “not accurate” that customers are moving from AWS to EU alternatives. “Our customers have control over where they store their data and how it is encrypted, and we make the AWS Cloud sovereign-by-design,” Straight says. “AWS services support encryption with customer managed keys that are inaccessible to AWS, which means customers have complete control of who accesses their data.” Staight says the membership of the PCLOB “does not impact” the agreements around EU-US data sharing and that the CLOUD Act has “additional safeguards for cloud content.” Google and Microsoft declined to comment.

> The potential shift away from US tech firms is not just linked to cloud providers. Since January 15, visitors to the European Alternatives website increased more than 1,200 percent. The site lists everything from music streaming services to DDoS protection tools, says Marko Saric, a cofounder of European cloud analytics service Plausible. “We can certainly feel that something is going on,” Saric says, claiming that during the first 18 days of March the company has “beaten” the net recurring revenue growth it saw in January and February. “This is organic growth which cannot be explained by any seasonality or our activities,” he says.

> While there are signs of movement, the impact is likely to be small—at least for now. Around the world, governments and businesses use multiple cloud services—such as authentication measures, hosting, data storage, and increasingly data centers providing AI processing—from the big three cloud and tech service providers. Cottlehuber says that, for large businesses, it may take many months, if not longer, to consider what needs to be moved, the risks involved, plus actually changing systems. “What happens if you have a hundred petabytes of storage, it's going to take years to move over the internet,” he says.

> For years, European companies have struggled to compete with the likes of Google, Microsoft, and Amazon’s cloud services and technical infrastructure, which make billions every year. It may also be difficult to find similar services on the scale of those provided by alternative European cloud firms.

> “If you are deep into the hyperscaler cloud ecosystem, you’ll struggle to find equivalent services elsewhere,” says Bert Hubert, an entrepreneur and former government regulator, who says he has heard of multiple new cloud migrations to US firms being put on hold or reconsidered. Hubert has argued that it is no longer “safe” for European governments to be moved to US clouds and that European alternatives can’t properly compete. “We sell a lot of fine wood here in Europe. But not that much furniture,” he says. However, that too could change.

> Schaake, the former member of the European Parliament, says a combination of new investments, a different approach to buying public services, and a Europe-first approach or investing in a European technology stack could help to stimulate any wider moves on the continent. “The dramatic shift of the Trump administration is very tangible,” Schaake says. “The idea that anything could happen and that Europe should fend for itself is clear. Now we need to see the same kind of pace and leadership that we see with defense to actually turn this into meaningful action.”

GOOGL,2024-08-13 21:03:15,reddit,"Bloomberg: US Considers a Rare Antitrust Move: Breaking Up Google
A rare bid to break up Alphabet Inc.’s Google is one of the options being considered by the Justice Department after a landmark court ruling found that the company monopolized the online search market, according to people with knowledge of the deliberations.

The move would be Washington’s first push to dismantle a company for illegal monopolization since unsuccessful efforts to break up Microsoft Corp. two decades ago. Less severe options include forcing Google to share more data with competitors and measures to prevent it from gaining an unfair advantage in AI products, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private conversations.

Regardless, the government will likely seek a ban on the type of exclusive contracts that were at the center of its case against Google. If the Justice Department pushes ahead with a breakup plan, the most likely units for divestment are the Android operating system and Google’s web browser Chrome, said the people. Officials are also looking at trying to force a possible sale of AdWords, the platform the company uses to sell text advertising, one of the people said.

The Justice Department discussions have intensified in the wake of Judge Amit Mehta’s Aug. 5 ruling that Google illegally monopolized the markets of online search and search text ads. Google has said it will appeal that decision, but Mehta has ordered both sides to begin plans for the second phase of the case, which will involve the government’s proposals for restoring competition, including a possible breakup request.

Alphabet shares fell as much as 2.5% to $160.11 in after-hours trading before erasing some losses.

A Google spokesman declined to comment on the possible remedy. A Justice Department spokeswoman also declined to comment.

The US plan will need to be accepted by Mehta, who would direct the company to comply. A forced breakup of Google would be the biggest of a US company since AT&T was dismantled in the 1980s.

Justice Department attorneys, who have been consulting with companies affected by Google’s practices, have raised concerns in their discussions that the company’s search dominance gives it advantages in developing artificial intelligence technology, the people said. As part of a remedy, the government might seek to stop the company from forcing websites to allow their content to be used for some of Google’s AI products in order to appear in search results.

**Breakup**

Divesting the Android operating system, used on about 2.5 billion devices worldwide, is one of the remedies that’s been most frequently discussed by Justice Department attorneys, according to the people. In his decision, Mehta found that Google requires device makers to sign agreements to gain access to its apps like Gmail and the Google Play Store.

Those agreements also require that Google’s search widget and Chrome browser be installed on devices in such a way they can’t be deleted, effectively preventing other search engines from competing, he found.

Mehta’s decision follows a verdict by a California jury in December that found the company monopolized Android app distribution. A judge in that case hasn’t yet decided on relief. The Federal Trade Commission, which also enforces antitrust laws, filed a brief in that case this week and said in a statement that Google shouldn’t be allowed “to reap the rewards of illegal monopolization.”

Google paid as much as $26 billion to companies to make its search engine the default on devices and in web browsers, with $20 billion of that going to Apple Inc.

Mehta’s ruling also found Google monopolized the advertisements that appear at the top of a search results page to draw users to websites, known as search text ads. Those are sold via Google Ads, which was rebranded from AdWords in 2018 and offers marketers a way to run ads against certain search keywords related to their business. About two-thirds of Google’s total revenue comes from search ads, amounting to more than $100 billion in 2020, according to testimony from last year’s trial.

If the Justice Department doesn’t call for Google to sell off AdWords, it could ask for interoperability requirements that would make it work seamlessly on other search engines, the people said.

**Data Access**

Another option would require Google to divest or license its data to rivals, such as Microsoft’s Bing or DuckDuckGo. Mehta’s ruling found that Google’s contracts ensure not only that its search engine gets the most user data – 16 times as much as its next closest competitor — but that data stream also keeps its rivals from improving their search results and competing effectively.

Europe’s recently enacted digital gatekeeper rules imposed a similar requirement that Google make available some of its data to third-party search engines. The company has said publicly that sharing data can pose user privacy concerns, so it only makes available information on searches that meet certain thresholds.

Requiring monopolists to allow rivals to have some access to technology has been a remedy in previous cases. In the Justice Department’s first case against AT&T in 1956, the company was required to provide royalty-free licenses to its patents.

In the antitrust case against Microsoft, the settlement required the Redmond, Washington, tech giant to make some of its so-called application programming interfaces, or APIs, available to third-parties for free. APIs are used to ensure that software programs can effectively communicate and exchange data with each other.

**AI Products**

For years, websites have allowed Google’s web crawler access to ensure they appear in the company’s search results. But more recently some of that data has been used to help Google develop its AI.

Last fall, Google created a tool to allow websites to block scraping for AI, after companies complained. But that opt-out doesn’t apply to everything. In May, Google announced that some searches will now come with “AI Overviews,” narrative responses that spare people the task of clicking through various links. The AI-powered panel appears underneath queries, presenting summarized information drawn from Google search results from across the web.

Google doesn’t allow website publishers to opt-out of appearing in AI Overviews, since those are a “feature” of search, not a separate product. Websites can block Google from using snippets, but that applies to both search and the AI Overviews.

While AI Overviews only appear on a fraction of searches, the feature’s roll-out has been rocky after some excerpts offered embarrassing suggestions, like advising people to eat rocks or to put glue on pizza.

Edit: Again, not saying that it actually started in China, but highlighting that everything is accelerating with AI systems which will define more optimal avenues for efficiency when it comes to workforce and for now some western hemisphere countries were relatively more protected given our labour laws and social safety nets. But with less employees, less savings for retirement or jobless earnings. Many topics /idea mixed below ( that’s the beauty of human brain/rambling vs edited by AI).

This trend is likely to accelerate within the next 24 months in Usa. With major cuts expected in the NYSE AI listed companies, significant profits can be made. AI teams will be affected too. A tale of a snake eating its own tail and flesh.

But with the size of the China workforce in a country that produces more than one million engineers yearly, and with the expected rise of unemployment and accelerating AI mechanics , we might be at the dawn of a geopolitical shift in china and a redefinition of the power imbalance between low cost production countries and emerging low cost production countries in all continents.

Jobs average lifespan for employees getting lower and lower. From lifetime jobs more than 60 years ago to 1 month lifespan very soon.

For the hard or brick and mortar stuff, wouldn’t be surprised in the near future, if technologies companies which typically don’t pay dividends on consistent basis morph into  structures like REITs ( Real Estate Investment Trusts) and become REITs( Robots Ecosystems Industrial Trusts). You buy a stock of a company owning robots and the entity will pay you monthly dividends; but instead of a bond like return growing slowly, Dividends increase on yearly basis will be more substantial given AI efficiencies. The valuation of these IT companies will be more marketable using the dividend growth model.

 Google’s new AI-powered chatbot Bard has stumbled at the first hurdle after it gave a misleading response during a demonstration at a launch event this week.

The AI search assistant, unveiled on Tuesday, is used by Google to generate text summaries of search results.

Yet in an animated image of Google Bard in action distributed by Google to mark the new feature’s launch, it gives a wrong answer.

The falsehood will raise further questions about the accuracy of search engines and of AI-generated answers to humans’ questions.

In an animated GIF showing how Bard works, a user types in the search query ""what new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope can I tell my 9 year old about?""

The NASA telescope was made operational in December 2021 and has been used by scientists to make several discoveries of new planets outside the Solar System.

One of the responses generated by Bard says: ""JWST took the very first pictures of a planet outside of our own solar system.""

Yet this is not accurate. The first picture ever taken of a planet outside the solar system - an exoplanet - was captured in 2004 by the Very Large Telescope array in Chile.

GOOGL,2025-06-02 18:15:39,reddit,"Alphabet stock could drop up to 25% if judge forces Google to sell Chrome, Barclays says
No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-stock-could-fall-as-much-as-25-in-black-swan-event-if-judge-orders-google-chrome-divestiture-174438942.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-stock-could-fall-as-much-as-25-in-black-swan-event-if-judge-orders-google-chrome-divestiture-174438942.html)

Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) stock could drop between 15% and 25% if US District Judge Amit Mehta orders Google to sell off its Chrome browser, Barclays analysts wrote in a note to investors Monday.

In August 2024, Google lost a landmark antitrust trial against the US Department of Justice. Judge Mehta found the tech giant guilty of monopolizing the search engine market — specifically, the markets for ""general search"" and ""general search text"" ads, which are ones that appear at the top of the search results page, Yahoo Finance’s Alexis Keenan reported.

Last Friday, Google and the Department of Justice wrapped up closing arguments in the remedies phase of the case. The Department of Justice argued that Mehta should force Google to divest its web browser, Chrome, and share its search data with rivals as well as ban its exclusivity agreements that secure Google as the default search engine on mobile devices and browsers, Keenan and Yahoo Finance’s Dan Howley reported.

Barclays analyst Ross Sandler wrote in a Monday note that “the probability of a Chrome divestiture, while low, has increased in our view,” following the closing arguments, adding that “the most likely candidates” to buy Chrome would be “well funded AI companies like OpenAI, Anthropic or perhaps Perplexity.”

Sandler said such an outcome would be “a major blow” to Google, given that Chrome has 4 billion users and represents 35% of Google’s search revenue.

“This would be a major development, a black swan event for GOOGL shares,” he said. “Shares would obviously trade off significantly if this were to play out as no investors we speak to are thinking this remedy plays out.”

Sandler said a Chrome divestiture would not only cause Alphabet stock to tumble as much as 25% but would also result in a potential 30% hit to Alphabet’s earnings per share.

“The reality is we don't know what the court is going to decide on remedies, we listened to the entire day of closing arguments and there were certainly times where we felt a lot worse than we did prior, and other times where we felt better (in terms of GOOGL stock price impact),” Sandler said. He holds an Overweight rating on the stock.

Mehta is expected to decide on a remedy in the case — and the fate of Google’s search empire — in August. Google said Saturday that it will appeal the case.

Separately on Monday, Alphabet said it agreed to spend $500 million to change its compliance structure in order to settle a case with shareholders accusing the company of antitrust violations.
