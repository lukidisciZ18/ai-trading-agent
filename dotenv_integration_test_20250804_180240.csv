""The interim award shares vest only if Musk remains in a key executive role through 2027. They also come with a five-year holding period except to cover tax payments or the purchase price.""

The original package valued at over $50 billion was voided by a Delaware court in 2024.  Musk appealed, and the Tesla board subsequently formed a special committee to consider some compensation.
